# Concurrent Programming i-Farm, the Organic Farm Activity Logging Application.

Context:

The organic farm certifying bodyforms a group of inspectors to conduct inspections on the organic farms on a timely basis, to enable the produce to meet all the requirements and criteria for organic plant  products.  This  allows  the  certifying  body  to  identify  and  eliminate  potential  frauds,  for example some farms may mix organic and inorganic products together for certification to increase the price of inorganic products. 


Problem:

Traditionally, during the organic farm inspection, the inspectors will check the farm’s activity logs, whichconsist of all farming activities carried out by the farmers on their plantation. Activity logs come with different formats in different farms, some in hand-written format and some in the Excel format. The inspectors then review the activity logs and consolidate the logs into a standard format. Finally,  they  perform  quantitative  and  qualitative  analysis  and  prepare  an  inspection  report  for certification.

The certifying body has engaged a team of software developers to help the farmers and inspectors digitalize the activity logging and inspection process into a paperless solution. The certifying body also  concerns  about  the  software system’s scalabilityto  process  the  growing  amount  of  data concurrently when there are more farmers using the system in the future.
